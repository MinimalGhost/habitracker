# HabiTracker

Build better behaviors by setting goals and tracking progress in real time.

## Installing / Getting Started

A pure Rails App using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling. The project was built using [Rails 5.1.4.](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2017/8/24/Rails-5-1-4-rc1-and-5-0-6-rc1-released/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database.

Fork and/or clone the repository down then `cd` into `habitracker` and run
```
rails db:migrate
rails s
```
to run database migrations and start the server on your local host. Then using your preferred browser open `http://localhost:3000/` and enjoy!
